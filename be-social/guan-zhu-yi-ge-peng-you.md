# 关注一个朋友

One of the great features on GitHub is the ability to see what other people are working on and who they are connecting with. When you follow someone, you’ll get notifications about their GitHub activity. Following friends helps you find new projects and new people that you may share interests with. You can see what some of your friends are interested in by looking at your [personal dashboard](https://github.com/dashboard) or you can check out what’s going on in the GitHub community by looking at [the Explore page](https://github.com/explore).

#### Step 1: Pick a friend.
