At some point you may want to stay up-to-date with a specific project. This is similar to following a person, except the focus is narrowed to only events in the project’s repository. You can choose to have notifications for this repository sent via email or viewable on the web by [configuring your settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications). Typical notifications would be comments on a Pull Request or an issue, or just a comment anywhere within the repository.

Our friend the Octocat has a repository called [Hello World](https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World) that we’d like to watch.

Once you are on the repository page, you will notice there is a “watch” button at the top of the page. Click on it.

Congratulations! You are now watching the Hello World repository. If the Octocat updates it, you will see what happened in your dashboard or receive a notification.
