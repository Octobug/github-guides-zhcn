# 你可以做更多的事情



You’ve done some of the most basic social interaction GitHub has to offer, but don’t stop there! Check out these other social features:

**Stargazing**

If you’re interested in some of the repositories your friends have starred in the past, but you no longer see it on your dashboard, head over to your [stars page](https://github.com/stars)and jump to another user!

**Discover Repositories**

After you’ve watched, followed, and starred your favorite people and repositories on GitHub, head over to your [Discover Repositories](https://github.com/dashboard/discover) page to see personalized repository recommendations based on these things!

**Explore / Newsletter**

The Explore page has repositories that have been starred by people you follow, GitHub staff, and general trending repositories right on the first page.

If you want to receive these as a newsletter daily, weekly, or monthly, check out the newsletter announcement at the bottom of the Explore page.

You can also configure this setting later at [the subscription page](https://github.com/explore/subscribe).

If you want to view just trending repositories and users, [head over to Trending](https://github.com/trending)and take a look.
