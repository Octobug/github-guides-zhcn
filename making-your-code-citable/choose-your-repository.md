# Choose your repository



Repositories are the most basic element of GitHub. They’re easiest to imagine as your project’s folder. The first step in creating a DOI is to select the repository you want to archive in Zenodo. To do so, head over to your profile and click the **Repositories** tab.

> **Important!** Make sure you tell people how they can reuse your work by including a license in your repository. If you don’t know which license is right for you, then take a look at [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com/).
