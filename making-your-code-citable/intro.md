# 简介



[Digital Object Identifiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) \(DOI\) are the backbone of the academic reference and metrics system. If you’re a researcher writing software, this guide will show you how to make the work you share on GitHub citable by archiving one of your GitHub repositories and assigning a DOI with the data archiving tool [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/about).

> **ProTip:** This tutorial is aimed at researchers who want to cite GitHub repositories in academic literature. Provided you’ve already set up a GitHub repository, this tutorial can be completed without installing any special software. If you haven’t yet created a project on GitHub, start first by [uploading your work](https://help.github.com/categories/importing-your-projects-to-github/) to a repository.
