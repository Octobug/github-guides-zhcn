# Finishing up

Back on your [Zenodo GitHub page](https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github) you should now see your repository listed with a shiny new badge showing your new DOI!

> **ProTip:** If you really want to show off, then right click on the gray and blue DOI image and copy the URL and place it in your README on your GitHub repo.
