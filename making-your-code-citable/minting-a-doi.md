# Minting a DOI

Before Zenodo can issue a DOI for your repository, you will need to provide some information about the GitHub repo that you’ve just archived.

Once you’re happy with the description of your software, click the **Publish** button at the bottom of the Zenodo form, and voilà, you’ve just made a new DOI for your GitHub repository!
