# Login to Zenodo

Next, head over to [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/) and click the **Log in** button at the top right of the page, which gives you an option to login with your GitHub account.

Zenodo will redirect you back to GitHub to ask for your permission to share your email address and the ability to configure [webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) on your repositories. Go ahead and click **Authorize application** to give Zenodo the permissions it needs.

> **Important!** If you want to archive a repository that belongs to an organization on GitHub, you will need to make sure that the organization administrator has enabled [third-party access](https://help.github.com/articles/approving-third-party-applications-for-your-organization/) to the Zenodo application.

#### Pick the repository you want to archive

At this point, youâ€™ve authorized Zenodo to configure the repository webhooks needed to allow for archiving and DOI-issuing. To enable this functionality, simply click the **On** toggle button next to your repository \(in this case **My-Awesome-Science-Software**\).

> **Important!** Zenodo can only access your public repositories so make sure the repository you want to archive is [public](https://help.github.com/articles/making-a-private-repository-public/).
