# Create a new release

By default, Zenodo takes an archive of your GitHub repository each time you create a new [Release](https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases). To test this out, head back to the main repository view and click on the **releases** header item.

Unless youâ€™ve created releases for this repository before, you will be asked to **Create a new release**. Go ahead and click this button and fill in the new release form.

If this is the first release of your code then you should give it a version number of `v1.0.0`. Fill in any release notes and click the **Publish release** button.

### Checking everything has worked

Creating a new release will trigger Zenodo into archiving your repository. You can confirm that this process took place by click the **Upload** tab in your Zenodo profile. You should see a new upload in the right-hand panel.
