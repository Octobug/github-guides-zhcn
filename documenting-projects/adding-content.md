# Adding content

Wiki content is designed to be easily editable. You can add or change content on any wiki page by clicking the **Edit** button located in the upper right corner of each page. This opens up the wiki editor.

Wiki pages can be written in any format supported by [GitHub Markup](http://github.com/github/markup). Using the drop-down menu in the editor, you can select the format of your wiki, and then use wiki toolbar to create and include content on a page. Wikis also give you the option of including a custom footer where you can list things like contact details or license information for your project.

GitHub keeps track of changes made to each page in your wiki. Below a page title, you can see who made the most recent edits, in addition to the number of commits made to the page. Clicking on this information will take you to the full page history where you can compare revisions or see a detailed list of edits over time.
