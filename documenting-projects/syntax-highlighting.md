# Syntax highlighting

Wiki pages support automatic syntax highlighting of code for a wide range of languages by using the following syntax:

```text
```ruby
  def foo
    puts 'bar'
  end
```
```

The block must start with three backticks, optionally followed by the the name of the language that is contained by the block. See [Pygments for the list of languages](http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/) that can be syntax highlighted.

The block contents should be indented at the same level as the opening backticks. The block must end with three backticks indented at the same level as the opening backticks.

### You’re done!

You have learned some important information about how to best share your work with the rest of the GitHub community, whether your project is large enough in scope for its own wiki or you’re just starting out and setting up a clear and concise README.
