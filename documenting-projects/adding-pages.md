# Adding pages

You can add additional pages to your wiki by selecting **New Page** in the upper right corner. By default, each page you create is included automatically in your wiki’s sidebar and listed in alphabetical order.

You can also add a custom sidebar to your wiki by clicking the **Add custom sidebar** link. Custom sidebar content can include text, images, and links.

Note: The page called “Home” functions as the entrance page to your wiki. If it is missing, an automatically generated table of contents will be shown instead.

If you're knowledgable with the command line, you can also modify wikis locally. Check out [our help article](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-and-editing-wiki-pages-locally) for more info.
