### 创建一个新的分支

当你在进行一个项目时，你可能会在任何给定的时间里有一堆不同的功能或想法——其中一些已经准备就绪，另一些则没有。分支的存在可以帮助你管理这些工作流程。

When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas. Changes you make on a branch don't affect the `master` branch, so you're free to experiment and commit changes, safe in the knowledge that your branch won't be merged until it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're collaborating with.
